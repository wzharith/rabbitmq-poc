RabbitMQ Playground

## What We Did

In this repository, we explored the following:

- Set up a RabbitMQ server locally.
- Created a producer that sends messages to a RabbitMQ queue.
- Developed a consumer that reads messages from the RabbitMQ queue.
- Demonstrated message acknowledgment and durability.
- Showcased error handling and retries.
- Monitored RabbitMQ using the management plugin.

This project serves as a playground to understand and experiment with RabbitMQ features.
